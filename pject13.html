                <p class="place-visit-desc float-left">When making a trip to Ieland, it is hard not to pay special attention to the country's namesake--namely, its 4,500 square miles of glacier. Ice climbing on the glaciers is
                practiced year-round and takes place mainly on the Solheimajokull and Svinafellsjokull glaciers in the south of Iceland to which day trips are offered from Reykjavik ( and Skaftafell).
